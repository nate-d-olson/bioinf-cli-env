## üì¶ Recommended Goose Extensions

### ‚úÖ Already-Enabled Recommended Extensions:
- `developer`: Direct code execution
- `memory`: Session memory management
- `computercontroller`: Automation and filesystem control
- `tutorial`: Getting started & tutorials

### ‚ûï Suggested Additional Extensions:

Currently, your extensions seem robust. However, as ongoing development becomes advanced, consider adding:
- **`github-copilot` extension** (if available): AI-enhanced coding recommendations, efficiency in script modifications
- **Database interaction extensions** (e.g., `sqlite`, `postgres`) if project moves toward data persistence or monitoring needs

Installation via Goose CLI:
```bash
goose install-extension github-copilot
```
